# HotCocoa::Graphics Examples

In this directory you will find several examples that illustrate the
graphics layer of HotCocoa.

You can run a small app to them from the command line using `macruby`.

```bash
 macruby demo.rb
```

You should then see a window open, but nothing will appear in the dock
since you ran the app from the command line using `macruby`.

These examples are drawing into an NSView, but they can also be used
to create PNG images or any other CoreGraphics context.
